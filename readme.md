This seems to be just another PHP Webclient for Music Player Daemon (http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/). 
But it is the continuation of the existing projects phpMp, phpMp+, phpMp2, phpMp3 and thus as stable as them,
although new an shiny. Simple and easy to use. New clients are welcome.

There is a huge number of webclients based on php for mpd out there. The project is going to join them into
one client collection. So each player is selectable through a nice selector. 

Projects which are already included in phpMpReloded:
* phpMp
* phpMp+
* phpMp2
* phpMp3
* IPodMp
* MPD-Web-Remote
* hempd

## Installation

* Install mpd (music player daemon) https://www.musicpd.org/download.html
* Install apache (web server with PHP) https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html
* unzip ***phpmpreloaded*** into your http docs directory
* if you like, modify the config *mpd/mpdconfig.php*
* you will find hempd under http://YOUR_DOMAIN/path/to/hempd/index.php
* ***phpmpreloaded*** will be your web remote control of *mpd*
* accessable music player for any wifi client
	
Enjoy!
